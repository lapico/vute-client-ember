## Example app

## Challenge (create a *Vute* record from this app)

* *Signup* a new user.
* Find a way to get your `resource_owner_id` (hint: use the *Vute's server app* [documentation](https://vute-server.herokuapp.com/doc)).

* Go to `https://vute-client-ember.herokuapp.com/users/~resource_owner_id~/vutes`
* Create your first *Vute*.
* Good luck :+1:
